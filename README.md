# State Based

The goal of this project is to provide a cleaned up version of 2022 Team 3534 House of Cards code structure for state based programming for FRC robots. 

This is a work in progress. Please reach out so we can have you become a tester. This will allow us to make the most of any feedback we get.

Hopefully some form of this becomes a standard option in WPILib.
